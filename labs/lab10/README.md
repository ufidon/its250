## Lab10: Malware analysis III: advanced static analysis

### 1. Description
Practice advanced static analysis techniques

* disassemble malware
* find the addresses of routines(functions) and data(variables)
* find the code flowchart of malware

on malware with disassemblers:
* IDA Pro
* Ghidra
* Radare2

This lab is revised from [Samscalss: Analyzing malwares with IDA Pro](https://samsclass.info/126/proj/PMA303c.htm).

**Prerequisite**

1. Work in the Windows VM with protection disabled in Lab03.
2. Download [malware.7z](./tools/malware.7z), archive password is "malware".
3. Download [ida free](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/) and install it with default options.


### 2. Tasks (100%)
With IDA free, analyze the following malwares:

1. (20%) Lab05-01.dll
   1. (5%) Open Lab05-01.dll in IDA free, it will be disassembled and the results will be displayed automatically
      1. (3%) Turn on the settings in IDA free to show line numbers (addresses) or hexadecimal instructions from  IDA Options box -> Disassembly tab -> "Display disassembly line parts" section, 
         1. Check "Line prefixes (graph)"
         2. Change "Number of opcode bytes" to 6
      2. (2%) Use SPACEBAR to switch between graph mode and text mode
   2. (7%) Find the Import for the Windows API function(actually, a macro) [gethostbyname](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wsipv6ok/nf-wsipv6ok-gethostbyname). 
      1. (1%) In IDA Pro, from menu View -> "Open subview" -> Imports, then find gethostbyname then double click it
      2. (2%) the code for gethostbyname opens in Text mode, double click it then press CTRL+X to open the "xrefs to gethostbyname" box. There are many calls (xrefs, or cross-references) to gethostbyname. Double-click the one at address of 1001656+101, the caller appears in the IDA View, analyze the parameters passed to gethostbyname.
      3. (2%) double click one of the parameters named off_10019040, the Text view is brought up and shows that this location contains a pointer to a string containing "praticalmalwareanalys".
      4. (2%) Switch to "Hex View-1" tab, find the four bytes starting at 10019040, which contain a 32-bit address in little-endian order, find this address. At this address, there's a series of ASCII values containing the domain that will be resolved by calling gethostbyname.
   3. (8%) Examinine the Code that References "\cmd.exe /c"
      1. (2%) In IDA Pro, from menu View -> "Open subview" -> Strings, find the String "\\cmd.exe /c", double click it open the "IDA View-A".
      2. (2%) The string "\\cmd.exe /c" appears in text mode. Click in the word cmd so it's highlighted and press Ctrl+x. A "xrefs to aCmd_exeC" box appears, double click the ref sub_1000FF58+278. There are two boxes of code use this string, one that starts a string with "cmd.exe -c" and the other that starts it with "command.exe /c". This looks like a remote shell, executing commands from the botmaster for either a 32-bit or 16-bit system.
      3. (2%) Drag the code boxes down to see the module containing "Hi, Master". This looks like a message the bot sends to the botmaster, further confirming that this is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool).
      4. (2%) Close IDA. Don't save the database.
2. (80%) Find the conditions for each [crackme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackme) to see the congratulation message. For each crackme, steps need to be completed are shown as in the first one.
   1. (20%) crackme-121-1.exe ( Find a password)
      1. (2%) Run in the command prompt without parameters, see how to use it
      2. (2%) Run in the command prompt with a guess, see error message
      3. (4%) Disassemble it with IDA Pro, find the interesting strings
      4. (4%) From the interesting strings, jump to the view of function flow chart
      5. (4%) Find the conditions that show congratulation message
      6. (4%) Try the conditions, such as passwords or command line in the command prompt to make sure you got the conditions
   2. (20%, distributed as previous one) crackme-121-2.exe ( Find a password)
   3. (20%, distributed as previous one) crackme-121-3.exe ( Find a password)
   4. (20%, distributed as previous one) crackme-121-4.exe ( Find a command line)
