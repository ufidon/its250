## Lab06: Vulnerability assessment

### 1. Description
Install Greenbone GVM on Ubuntu then launch it from Ubuntu, carry out a vulnerability assessment (scan) on the Windows server VM to find its vulnerabilities.

**Prerequisite**

* Both Windows server VM and the Ubuntu VM are used
* Install Greenbone GVM on Ubuntu

You may follow this [installation video](https://youtu.be/oq3rhIjrnGM).

```bash
# 0. Update the system
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 1. Install postgresql dbs
sudo apt install postgresql --fix-missing

# 2. Start postgresql and check its status
# sudo pg_ctlcluster 12 main start or
sudo systemctl start postgresql@12-main
sudo systemctl status postgresql@12-main

# 3. add Greenbone gvm ppa and install
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mrazavi/gvm
sudo apt install gvm
# during the installation
# 1. Do you want to enable redis unix socket in /etc/redis/redis.conf? Choose YES
# 2. Configure database for gvmd-pg with dbconfig-common? Choose YES
# 3. Host name of the PostgreSQL database server for gvmd-pg: Choose localhost
# 4. PostgreSQL application password for gvmd-pg: LEAVE IT BLANK and let it to be generated randomly.

# 4. Update greenbone (TAKE LOTS OF TIME)
# populate nvt
sudo greenbone-nvt-sync
# populate cves 
sudo greenbone-scapdata-sync 
sudo -u gvm -g gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type SCAP
# polulate cert
sudo greenbone-certdata-sync 
sudo -u gvm -g gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type CERT
# 5. Access https://localhost:9392/ in a browser

# 6. In case you have the problem that the scan configs are missing
sudo -u gvm -g gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA
```


### 2. Tasks (80%)
Carry out vulnerability assessment on the Windows VM from the Ubuntu VM.

1. (5%) Find the IP addresses of your Windows server VM and Ubuntu VM, make sure they can ping each other
2. (5%) Access https://localhost:9392/ in a browser, login with the default credential.
3. (10%) Create a scan config for scanning Windows only
4. (10%) Create a scan task with the config above and start it
5. (40%,8% each) Investigate the scan results
   1. Dashboard
   2. Scans -> Tasks
   3. Scans -> Reports
   4. Scans -> Results
   5. Scans -> Vulnerabilities
6. (10%) Export the scan results, try all the format to see which of them are successfully exported, for each of the successful outputs, take a screenshot of a portion of its content.

### 3. Review questions (20%, each 10%)
1. Use the CVSS calculator built-in Greenbone GVM to assess the severity of TWO of the vulnerabilities with different scores found above.
