## Lab01: Setup lab environment
### 1.Description
**In this lab, we will build our own penetration test toolset incrementally instead of using existent ones such as Kali Linux.**

* Install [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your PC. The physical computer you use is called a "Host". The virtual machines that run on it are called "Guests". 
* Create a virtual machine for Ubuntu Linux
* Create a virtual machine for Windows server
* *Rule of thumb to choose software: always choose the latest and STABLE version*

**Prerequisite:**

Your PC must support virtualization which is popular today, following the section 'Check virtualization availability' in the reference to find its availability and enable it.

### 2.Steps
1. (20%, 10% for each VM) Create two virtual machines, one for Ubuntu Linux, the other for Windows server
   * NAT network settings:
     * Use VMnet8 in VMware Workstation Player, or
     * Create a NAT network in VirtualBox
   * VM settings:
     * *2GB memory/100GB dynamic disk*
     * Connect to VMnet8/NAT network
     * It is a best practice to set VM's IP address statically
     * Enable network promiscuous mode


2. (40%)Install Ubuntu Linux
Follow the steps below to setup Ubuntu mate Linux in its VM:

   * (5%)Download [Ubuntu Mate Linux](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/) from its official website --- [https://ubuntu-mate.org](https://ubuntu-mate.org). Choose the 64-Bit ISO.
   * (15%)Install the downloaded Ubuntu Mate Linux
   * (10%)Update Ubuntu Mate Linux then install popular tools


After installation, *make sure you can access Internet*, update and upgrade Ubuntu, then install the following tools. Open a terminal window, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https dirmngr vim geany okular
sudo apt install p7zip-full build-essential gcc perl cmake automake curl git 
```
   * (5%)Install VMWare tool/VirtualBox Guest Additions in the guest Ubuntu.

3. (40%)Install Windows server

   * (5%)Download [Windows Server 2019 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server)
   * (15%)Install this Windows server
   * (10%)Enable ping response in the firewall settings of the guest Windows server
   * (5%)Install VMWare tool/VirtualBox Guest Additions in the guest Windows server

4. (10%, 2% each) Show the NAT network is working
	 * On the Windows host, find the ip configuration of Ethernet adapter VMware Network Adapter VMnet8: 	ipconfig /all
	 * On the Windows Server VM, find its ip configuration of the Ethernet adapter connected to the NAT: 	ipconfig /all
	 * On the Ubuntu Linux VM, find its ip configuration of the Ethernet adapter connected to the NAT: 	ifconfig -a
	 * from the Windows server VM ping the Ubuntu VM
	 * from the Ubuntu VM ping the Windows server VM


5. (Optional)Install Kali Linux
Create a VM for Kali Linux then follow the steps below to setup Kali Linux in its VM:

   * Download [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) from its official website --- [https://www.kali.org/](https://www.kali.org/). Choose the 64-Bit Installer ISO.
   * Install the downloaded Kali Linux following its [official installation instructions](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/)
   * Update Kali Linux then install popular tools


After installation, *make sure you can access Internet*, update and upgrade Ubuntu, then install the following tools. Open a terminal window, run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. populate the repository
# use a text editor open /etc/apt/sources.list with sudo then add the following two lines if there are not there
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
# 2. update, upgrade Kali then install several popular tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https dirmngr
sudo apt install p7zip-full build-essential gcc perl cmake automake curl git geany okular vim
```
   * Install VMWare tool/VirtualBox Guest Additions in the guest Kali Linux.
